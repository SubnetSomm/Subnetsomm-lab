# Subnetsomm-lab
“The digital cellar of subnetsomm — exploring cybersecurity, networking, and everything in between. A work-in-progress, just like a good fermentation.”

Welcome to the digital cellar.

This is my personal lab space where I document my journey into cybersecurity, networking, and IT fundamentals. It's a mix of notes, small tools, scripts, and hands-on experiments — all from the perspective of a beginner transitioning into the field.

## 🔍 Topics I'm Exploring
- Networking basics (TCP/IP, DNS, routing, etc.)
- Linux commands & scripting
- Cybersecurity fundamentals
- Ethical hacking labs
- Protocol analysis
- Tools like Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite, etc.

## ⚙️ Goals
- Build a strong foundation in cybersecurity
- Document everything I learn in a digestible, sharable way
- Grow this lab as my skills develop — from basic to advanced
